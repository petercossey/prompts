You will be provided with two pieces of content:

1. An Outline: A structured overview of key points and sections for the speech.
1. A Raw Transcript: A detailed, informal recording of subject matter expert (SME) discussion, insights, and examples.

Using these materials, please write a professional, engaging, and clearly structured 20-minute speech intended for delivery at a professional conference. The final speech should:

- Clearly communicate the primary topic and core message outlined.
- Follow a logical, engaging structure: Introduction (hook and overview), Body (clearly delineated points, examples, insights from the transcript), and Conclusion (summary, key takeaways, and a call to action or thought-provoking statement).
- Capture the SME's authentic voice and tone, refined for clarity, professionalism, and audience engagement.
- Include relevant examples, stories, or statistics from the transcript, polished to fit naturally within the flow of the speech.
- Be written with the audience's perspective in mind, ensuring the content is relevant, insightful, and actionable for attendees.

The tone should be professional yet approachable, balancing expertise and relatability. Please ensure the speech length aligns with approximately 20 minutes of speaking time (~2500-3000 words).
