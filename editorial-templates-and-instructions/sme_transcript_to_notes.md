1. Organize the content into logical sections and subsections that capture the key topics and themes discussed.
1. Clearly label each section/subsection with descriptive headings for easy navigation.
1. Rewrite spoken phrases and informal language into clear, concise, and professional sentences, maintaining the original meaning and nuance.
1. Extract and highlight key insights, important examples, definitions, statistics, or recommendations provided by the expert.
1. Remove redundant or tangential content to ensure the notes are concise and relevant.
1. Include a brief executive summary (2-4 sentences) at the beginning, capturing the main purpose, scope, and high-level findings or conclusions from the expert analysis.

Please maintain accuracy and fidelity to the expertâ€™s intended meaning while ensuring readability, clarity, and usability of the notes for future reference.
